# SPA Call Manager Pro
Call management &amp; personal directory for Linksys &amp; Cisco phones.

# Installation instructions
Download installer from:
[atrejoe.github.io/SPA-Call-Manager-Pro](http://atrejoe.github.io/SPA-Call-Manager-Pro/Cisco.application "GitHub").

# Configuration
~~For configuration instruction of both the application and the phone, see:
[Configuring SPA Callamanager Pro](http://www.spacallmanager.com/setup-configuring-spa-call-manager-pro/)~~

Instruction with images appear to have been lost, here's the short version:

In SPA Callmanager pro setup window:
- enter your phone's ip address
- enter the admin pass
- optionally enter a directory for the shared address book

Go the Web UI of your phone (ask your sysadmin or look in your phone):
- enable CTI
- enable debugging
- set debugging server to your own ip address (displayed in the setup window)

*NB: the password will be saved in your registry unencrypted (this is a known issue)*
